// Handle a Rejected Promise with catch
// catch is the method used when your promise has been rejected. It is executed immediately after a promise's reject method is called. Hereâ€™s the syntax:

// myPromise.catch(error => {
  
// });
// error is the argument passed in to the reject method.

// Add the catch method to your promise. Use error as the parameter of its callback function and log error to the console.

// Tests

  });
  
  // Handle the rejected promise with the catch method
