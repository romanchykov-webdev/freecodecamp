// Declare String Variables
// Previously you used the following code to declare a variable:

// var myName;
// But you can also declare a string variable like this:

// var myName = "your name";
// "your name" is called a string literal. A string literal, or string, is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

// Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

var myLastName = "YourLastName";
