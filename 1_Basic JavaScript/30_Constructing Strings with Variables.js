// Constructing Strings with Variables
// Sometimes you will need to build a string. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

// Example:

// const ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
// const ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.

// Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings My name is  and  and I am well!

// Get Help
// Tests
// Waiting:myName should be set to a string at least 3 characters long.
// Waiting:You should use two + operators to build myStr with myName inside it.

const myName = "YourName"; // Replace YourName with your actual name
const myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
