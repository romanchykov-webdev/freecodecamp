// Nest one Array within Another Array
// You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

// const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
// This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

// Create a nested array called myArray.

// Get Help
// Tests
// Waiting:myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
