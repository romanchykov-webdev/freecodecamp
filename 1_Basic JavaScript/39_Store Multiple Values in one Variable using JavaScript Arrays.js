// Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
// With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

// You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

// const sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"];
// Modify the new array myArray so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

// Get Help
// Tests
// Waiting:myArray should be an array.
// Waiting:The first item in myArray should be a string.
// Waiting:The second item in myArray should be a number.

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = ["Hello, world!", 42];
