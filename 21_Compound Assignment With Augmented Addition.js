// Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition
// In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable. Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

// myVar = myVar + 5;
// to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

// One such operator is the += operator.

// let myVar = 1;
// myVar += 5;
// console.log(myVar);
// 6 would be displayed in the console.

// Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the += operator.

// Waiting:a should equal 15.
// Waiting:b should equal 26.
// Waiting:c should equal 19.
// Waiting:You should use the += operator for each variable.
// Waiting:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.


let a = 3;
let b = 17;
let c = 12;

// Only change code below this line
a += 12;
b += 9;
c +=7;
